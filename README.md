### Content

* The inspiration for the design of the game was taken from a two-part video lesson created by YouTube content creators [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFbNIlppjAuEX4znoulh0Cw) and [PortEXE](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjGQyJCSU_VVMTu5nigonqg). The [first video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28VfzEiJgy4) focuses on the HTML and CSS needed to create the game, and the [second](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uuQ3g92oPQ) is centered of the JavaScript functionality.

* The fonts used to style the header and subheader texts are [ZCOOL Kwaile](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/ZCOOL+KuaiLe) and [Architects Daughter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Architects+Daughter?preview.text=Time%20Flips&preview.text_type=custom#standard-styles) respectively. The latter was designed by [Kimberley Geswein](https://fonts.google.com/?preview.text=Time%20Flips&preview.text_type=custom&query=Kimberly+Geswein), and the former by [ZCOOL](https://fonts.google.com/?query=ZCOOL), [Liu Bingke](https://fonts.google.com/?query=Liu+Bingke), [Yang Kang](https://fonts.google.com/?query=Yang+Kang), and [Wu Shaojie](https://fonts.google.com/?query=Wu+Shaojie).
